        "answer": "might mean the lightning towers and the strongbacks so a surrounding pad 40 right now are lightning uh deflection Towers not I'm not quite sure on the correct terminology there but those two those uh four tall towers running the rocket are there to essentially um protect the rocket from any lightning\r\n(10:23) strikes and they have cabling um like cat Mary wires I think they're called exactly yes thank you uh linking all the way down to the ground to disperse the charge and not focus it all on one on one exact point I.E a potentially fueled rocket uh because that would cause a bad day and a huge headache for many people involved um and I guess the fifth Tower I guess if that's what they mean uh they mean the rocket it's oh go ahead yeah uh and behind the rocket is what we call the strong back uh structure it is what\r\n(10:56) provides vertical support and also umbilicals and feeling uh potential for Falcon 9 before it takes to the skies",

        "answer": "it is headed at on a Southeast trajectory uh at a 43 degree orbital inclination so that doesn't happen too often uh out here at the cape uh and the window for that normally is toward the either the end or the beginning or like I should say the first three and the one and the last three months of the the year uh just based on the way the Earth is oriented with the sun and also with the way it's tilted as well so it's more advantageous uh you could say to launch at those times a year for these certain trajectories",

        "answer": "mark one eyeballs for sure uh yeah it should definitely be visible from Miami tonight and one other thing that I want to point out is we have a near full moon uh at our backs so we may get some cool\r\n(23:44) visuals at Second Stage ignition and we may be able to track it for a bit longer because the second stage exhaust gases may be lit up by the Moonlight oh that's exciting jellyfish",

        "answer": "think there are currently two Falcon 9 boosters in the fleet holding at uh 15 flights one is beloved b1058 uh that the booster with the only worm logo on it in the entire fleet it's also the booster that uh first launched uh NASA astronauts from the US for the first time since shuttle back in 2020.\r\n(33:40) um I cannot recall uh the second booster serial number no worries off the top of my head 1060. thank you yep um so there are currently two falconized holding at 15 flights uh we are unsure of their future but we know that SpaceX decided to expend two Falcon 9 block 5 boosters last year and they weren't exactly that close to 15 flights so I'm not exactly sure the requirements or these scenarios in to which SpaceX would uh prefer or have to expend a booster or a what process they would go through to choose\r\n(34:18) that unlucky uh booster from uh the fleet",

        "answer": "it depends on what you want to call reliability I will argue that probably having a lot of flights in a row very successfully even if you started off\r\n(50:53) with a few failures might be a good um a good indication and right now Falcon 9 is definitely on that on on that realm because like it's it's the first rocket that will probably reach 200 flights in a row without without a failure again knocking boot because it's three flights away from that this was the 197th uh flight since the mo6 failure on the ban I one could argue that well because it was on the pan and things like that you could count like the sort of eight scenes between CR7 and ml6 whatever I count from m06 three more\r\n(51:29) launches and they get to 200 of those in a row successfully",
