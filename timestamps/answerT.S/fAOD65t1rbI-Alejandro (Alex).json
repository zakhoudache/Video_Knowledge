        "answer": "yep that's why there there are 56 of them if it if it were uh V2 minis they are larger and more heavier um so what what basically what they do is just they load less of them um so they have about 21 for each launch of V2 minis in this case it is V 1.5",

        "answer": "I have it as 8.2359 that's not really meaningful about eight days right um for 39.\r\n(13:31) 8 a little bit longer because they have had a few issues here and there with the scheduling it's right now at 26 days and sleep for East one of Vandenberg uh on the west coast that is about 14 days so I guess the slowest pad right now this year is lc39a the fastest is this one slick 40 and in between Vandever comes in you know at about two weeks between launches",

        "answer": "the only two failures of Falcon 9 were were from the second stage yeah but I mean one was on launch one was right that's what is it CRS seven yes crs7 and 806 um and both of them were actually because of the copvs those are are painting the back for for the SpaceX no\r\n(16:44) no wonder why they're trying to get rid of them uh for for Starship they're still there though um because man it's you need a lot of high gas pressure you know bottles in in these Rockets So yeah but at least they are not inside of the tanks",

        "answer": "ever since 20, 21 sort of September all of the launches since then have had Starling satellites that include laser\r\n(25:28) Communications between but they they are lesser Communications between them not with the ground which is much harder because you got to go through the atmosphere and all that stuff and it's a little bit more wacky uh but yeah the the connection between the satellites it is with with laser Communications",

        "answer": "this Mission should should actually um if you if you see the the article that we put out for for the overview of this Mission uh it actually points out that with this launch they already will have 4 000 satellites in orbit now that doesn't mean that they haven't that they have launched four thousand stunning satellites they have launched more but since the first launch of starlink satellites they've been a few of them uh let's say right that haven't stayed in\r\n(28:23) orbit and so right now with these 56 uh that number of satellites a little bit will be more than than uh four thousand now the number of satellites that have been deployed though it's closer to 4 300 um it's right now 4284. with this uh if I do the math real quick here with my calculator uh that should be completely seamless way to go four thousand three hundred and forty satellites in total that will have been launched um of them you know a bunch of them have already re-entered and things like that so in orbit at least more than four\r\n(29:05) thousand",
